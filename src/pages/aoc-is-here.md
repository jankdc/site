It's that time of the year! I've decided to try out [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) (AoC) this year, to procrastinate from my coding projects...with another coding project. I've seen AoC float around HN for awhile now and I've sadly never participated in it. If you're not aware, it's a website with fun programming challenges, where new challenges are revealed each day, in the style of an advent calendar.

The format of each problem is fun. Less interview style coding challenges that puts a sour taste in one's mouth, but more Professor Layton style of storytelling where for some reason, a lot of his problems before Christmas are computer science-related. Now that most of my coding happens with AI, the boilerplate muscle memory has atrophied with it so it's a good stretch.

I'll try to finish all the challenges to get those ASCII Christmas LED lights all nice and pretty. I'll review the challenges as I go along.
