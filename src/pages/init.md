Hey there.

I haven't written publicly in ages. It feels weird. Like I'm about to talk to a therapist for the first time. Or god, whichever is more relatable. It's vulnerable because it's a type of expression. And it's gonna be read by you. Tons more people like you. That might really **not** like it. Or worse, they might actually like it, and want more. Actually, the reality is, not a lot of people are gonna read it. It's probably just gonna be me, writing in the void. Which is great, because that's exactly how I want it.
